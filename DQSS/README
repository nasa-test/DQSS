   PURPOSE: How to run DQSS

Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable 
perhaps /usr  or  /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_32

Scripts:
These scripts runs DQSS with 64 bit HDFView libraries that come with this package.
If you need to recompile or want more details refer to README_BATCH

Under the MODIS AIRS and MLS directories you will find:

runWithOntologyXML.csh - This script runs DQSS with pre-defined XML files under the ./testing directory.
                         The script contains examples on how to run from command line


runUsingOntologyURL.csh  This script runs DQSS with using the DQSS Ontology. If the servlet interface
			 is not available then it will use classes in onboardinterface.jar
                         The servlet interface requires ONTOLOGYURL in dqss.config to be set correctly
                         The onboard interface requires ONTOLOGY and ONBOARDPROPERTIES in dqss.config to be set correctly
                         The script contains examples on how to run from command line. You will have to uncomment the line you want to run.
